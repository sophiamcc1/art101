            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this lab was to work together with our lab partners and experiment with
                jQuery and AJAX.
            </p>

            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>I had a bit of difficulty getting the button to run. However, after scanning through my code, I
                realized that I had not typed out one of my commands correctly. I was able to fix this error and
                my code ran smoothly. 
            </p>

        <div class="minor-section">
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>This lab allowed me to use some of the debugging skills I learned in the previous lab. After testing
                my code with no positive results, I looked through my work and found the command that was causing the 
                problem. This lab was much easier for me to complete with the new knowledge I have gained from Lab 14.
