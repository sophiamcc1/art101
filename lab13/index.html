        <div class="minor-section">
            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>We worked together with a partner to experiment with loop commands.</p>
             </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>I struggled to get the code to work at first. It was not a major problem, I just realized that I 
                had added the wrong link to my html. Nadia and I both worked to get our results to appear on the 
                page rather than just in JavaScript. We used Wesbot and W3Schools for assistance with the issues
                we couldn't figure out together.
            </p>
             </div>

        <div class="minor-section">
            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>I reread the slides and looked at the examples for further assistance when I ran into some issues.
                Nadia helped me with some more confusing bits of the lab but we were able to complete it.
