                       Together, we worked on creating and experimenting with DOM expansion in JavaScript!

                       I had several problems during this lab. While I cleared any issues I might have had similar
                       to the previous lab, new ones left me stuck. The text appeared before I clicked the button,
                       and I could not get the click command to work on my button. However, Nadia helped me solve this
                       issue, as she ran into something similar, and we were able to work through it.

                       I understood more of the expectations of this lab than I did the last but I still ran into problems. 
                       The programming is definitely getting more challenging for me, but I am learning a lot with each lab.
