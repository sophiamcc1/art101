			<h1>Lab 4 - Subject/Topic</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab introduced pseudocoding. The purpose of the lab was to get used to
						thinking in terms of pseudocoding before starting actual code.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>We struggled with finding a good topic for each of our sections. We brainstormed
						several ideas and discussed some topics before ultimately choosing the ones
						provided in our lab.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I researched some of the more simple games after discussing with Nadia. There were 
						some games that were included in the examples provided that I did not want to 
						include for authenticity. So I had to research some ideas for games that we would be 
						able to pseudocode. Coming up with some ideas for the everyday tasks was easier to 
						choose.</p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
					<div class="pseudocode">
						<pre><code>
							// Everyday Task: Replacing a Light Bulb

							// Select the corresponding bulb for the light fixture
							// Ensure the power to the required fixture is off
								//Do not proceed until the electricity has been turned off
							// Remove any external covers to the fixture such as covers, fittings, shades, etc.
							// Remove the old bulb after it has reached a cool temperature
							// Apply the new bulb
								// Align it carefully into the fixture
							// Reassemble the fixture cover
							// Restore power to test the new bulb functionality
							// Dispose of the old bulb safely
								//Use caution, fragile glass

							
								//Simple Game: Snake

								// Upon set up create game_area 
								// Upon set up place snake at a coordinate within the game_area (x,y)
								// Set initial_direction for snake to right 
								// Place food randomly on the grid

								// Make a function for game_over and set it to false

								// When game_over = false
								// Detect user input for direction (up,down,left,right arrow keys)
								// this ensure that the user cannot trigger game_over by going into themselves
									// If input_direction is u,d,l,r and is not opposite of the current_direction 
									// Then set current_direction = input_direction 

								// Make new_head_position function and base it off current_direction 

									// Create collision detection
										// If new_head_position is outside game_area or new_head_position is in snake
											// et game_over to true 

									// this simulates the illusion of movement 
								// if new_head_position = food_position 
									// Add a new_head_position to the beginning of the snake and place new 
									// food randomly on the grid (where there is no snake)
									// else remove the last part of the snake tail

								// If all food collected and no more space in game_area 
								// set game_over to true and display “You Win!”
								// Else game_over = false
