            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this lab was to use obtained debugging knowledge to work on previous labs
                and fix any issues that they may have.
            </p>

            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>The only problems I had with this lab was finding how many stupid mistakes I made in previous ones
                that prevented them from running properly. :D
            </p>

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>This lab made me understand how important revising code can be. The smallest mistakes can have the 
                biggest impact on the final results. Thankfully, all of my mistakes were caught with the help of my 
                lab partner, Nadia, and all of my labs are running smoothly.

            <h2>Debugging</h2>
            <p>Below are screenshots of my fixed code and final results. The mistakes I made were minor, but affected 
                the final product of my labs. In lab 12, I called a variable that didn't exist. In lab 13, I didn't 
                add a # before action in my JavaScript. After finding and fixing these errors, the code ran smoothly.
