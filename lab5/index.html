			<h1>Lab 5 - Subject/Topic</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal of this lab was to define variables!.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I ran into a couple technical problems but after some reference to the instructions
						and asking my coding partner Nadia for assistance it was a simple fix.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Each lab is getting easier for me, giving me confidence in programming. I was able to do 
						most of the work for the lab without having problems, and only asked for help once.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					This page is the result of the lab! My lab partner and I worked together on the formatting 
					of our pages. I am happy with the results. The photo included is of my actual car, the day I got her.
