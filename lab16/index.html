            <h2>Challenge</h2>
            <p>The purpose of this lab was to work together with our lab partners and experiment with
                processing JSON from and API.
            </p>

        <div class="minor-section">
            <h2>Problems</h2>
            <p>I couldn't get the URLs to work. My commands seemed to be correct, but the URL line was giving 
                me issues. My lab partner experienced a similar issue, so we asked WesBot and ChatGPT for assistance.
                Eventually, we were encouraged to edit the URL line and use a code component, which resolved the issue.

            <h2>Reflection</h2>
            <p>This was a fun final lab! I was a bit frustrated when I couldn't figure out what the issue was with my code,
                but after fixing it with the help of ChatGPT, the final product was worth it.
