			<h1>Lab 8 - Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>We worked together to experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I ran into an issue with the console results, continuously getting error messages
                        after inputting my commands. After discussing my issue with my lab partner, I 
                        realized that I was missing a line of code commands. The issue was fixed and it helped
                        me complete the remainder of the assignment with no issue. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This was a fun lab, I did find it interesting that my console results counted 59 as 
                        an even number which is not true. I made sure that my JavaScript would not have the 
                        same issue. I do not know why the console was counting an odd number as even. </p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results</h2>

                    <p>The console is the result of my efforts for this lab!</p>
