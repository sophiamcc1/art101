            <h1>Hello World</h1>

            <p>My name is Sophia and I am a transfer AGPM major with no programming experience. 
                I enjoy character design, digital art, and Miguel O'Hara. Since I am planning on working with games 
                for my future career, I know that programming will benefit me greatly. My partner, 
                Nadia, has coding experience and I have worked with her in a previous class. We both share 
                interests with the Spiderverse franchise.</p>
