					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge of this lab was to program an aesthetically pleasing webpage of choice,
						including "Hello World" and information about ourselves along with our partner.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>A problem we both shared was linking the CSS file to the HTML file. After reviewing
						the examples provided on the assignment page and tutorials, we were able to solve 
						the issue. I had some personal issues in the beginning, as well as with color, and Nadia 
						was able to walk me through the process. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This was the first time I have programmed without direct assistance. I was a bit nervous in 
						the beginning, but I managed to complete much more than I expected on my own, which I am proud
						of. Of course, when I was not understanding the examples provided or felt lost, 
						I asked Nadia, who was very patient with my questions. I hope that I might be able to help her 
						for future assignments if I can. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Results</h2>
					<p>We were both successful in completing our webpages, both to our liking!</p>
