                       The goal of this lab was to work with jQuery to link our pages to the html.

                    <h2> 
                        Problems
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                       I ran into a few problems with the lab regarding my css files. It was a bit challenging to
                        find ways to prevent them from overlapping. Luckily, we were able to work together and solve
                        the issue.

                    <h2>
                        Reflection
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                       This lab was tricky in some aspects and I had some difficulty with the 
                        css commands. Nadia and I walked through the process together since we were having similar issues. 
                        The buttons are a result of our efforts. :3
