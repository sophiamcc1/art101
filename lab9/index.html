			<h1>Lab 9 - Libraries and jQuery</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The goal of this lab was to work with jQuery to link our pages to the html.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I ran into a few problems with the lab regarding my css files. It was a bit challenging to
                        find ways to prevent them from overlapping. Luckily, we were able to work together and solve
                        the issue.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was tricky in some aspects and I had some difficulty with the 
                        css commands. Nadia and I walked through the process together since we were having similar issues. </p>
