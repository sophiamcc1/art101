			<h1>Lab 3 - Subject/Topic</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The idea of this lab was to add onto the local file structure on the computer
						and create more index.html files for our websites.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I experienced strange updates onto my page where any saved work would 
						not appear on my webpage, instead showing pre-made files like the README.md.
						Luckily, I was able to fix most of the problems on my own, but did ask my partner
						for help.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Despite this lab being the easiest, I had a much harder time with it than I did the 
						previous two. There were strange updates that my webpage would make and I could not 
						figure out the causes. But eventually, I managed to fix them on my own. </p>
			</div>

					<h2>Results</h2>

					<p>My website has been personalized and my files are all organized with the template provided:</p>
