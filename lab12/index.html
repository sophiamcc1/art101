                       The lab encouraged us to work together to create a function dependent on conditionals.

                    <h2> 
                        Problems
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                       I ran into a couple problems getting my commands to work. The formatting worked fine,
                       and everything was appearing on my page. But after inputting a name, it would not produce
                       results. Nadia and I both shared similar problems and worked through them together.

                       I was a bit frustrated with this lab. There was a lot of work to cover and it was overwhelming.
                       But I did have fun with the topics I chose for the lab. It was rewarding to see everything come 
                       together in the end.
