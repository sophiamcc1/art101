					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab focused on experimenting with arrays and objects in JavaScript with
						our partners.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some technical issues with my links but I reread through the instructions
						and was able to get them working!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I referenced the examples provided a lot for this lab to ensure that I was providing
						correct information. I did not want minor mistakes to cause any problems with my work
						and my partner and I reviewed our work together as we progressed. </p>
