			<h1>Lab 7 - Functions</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>This lab focused on creating functions that take in user input as well as manipulating strings.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had some difficulty getting some of the functions to work. I ran into several errors but 
                        my partner Nadia helped me work through them. We both worked through transferring the JS
                        file into the html page.
                    </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This lab was a bit more challenging than previous ones as I had some difficulty with the 
                        commands. I experiemented with the shortened variant of the commands and could not get
                        them to run. Nadia helped me through the process and I used the lengthened version. They 
                        were more visually helpful for me to use. </p>
