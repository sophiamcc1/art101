                       This lab encouraged us to experiment with JavaScript events. We are continuing to learn and
                       explore with different commands in JavaScipt.

                    <p>
                       This was the first lab in a while that I was able to complete without running into many problems.
                       We both explored the new commands that we learned during lecture and put them to use in our lab. 
                       After asking Wesbot for some help during minor setbacks, we successfully completed the lab.

                       The past few labs that I have been struggling with have helped me find problems before they start and
                       relook through my code. As a result, Lab 11 ran much more smoothly for me. It was not as much of a challenge
                       as the past labs were.
